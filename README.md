TripNDroid Mobile Engineering - FFTW3 for Android
=================================================

FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in
one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of both real and complex data
(as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).

## Info

* can be compiled within almost any android source (nougat tested)
* produces 32/64 bit libs (libfftw3.so)
* include libfftw3 as shared library to use fftwf functions
